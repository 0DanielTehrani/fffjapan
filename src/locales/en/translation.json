    "What Is FFFJapan? Title": "What is FridaysForFuture Japan?",
    "What Is FFFJapan?": "FridaysForFuture is a movement that started in August 2018, when 15 year old Greta Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish parliament every school day for three weeks, to protest against the lack of action on the climate crisis. Her actions evoked young people’s empathies  and the movement soon went viral. In the one week action “Global Week for Future” in September 2019, more than 7 million people from around the world joined the strikes and demanded action towards climate change. There are many young people who support this movement in Japan as well. In February of 2019, the FridaysForFuture in Japan started from Tokyo. Ever since the start, our movement is growing little by little in Japan with the youth at its heart.",
